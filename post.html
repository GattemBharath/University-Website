          <h3>Learn Web Development the easiest way</h3>
          <p>
            Every Web Developer must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. Responsive Web Design is used in all types of modern
            web development. ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript 5) is supported in all
            modern browsers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Steps to learn web development basics: Learn the basics of how
            websites work, front-end vs back-end, and using a code editor Learn
            basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Learn tools: package managers, build
            tools, version control Learn Sass, responsive design, JavaScript
            frameworks Learn back-end basics: servers and databases, programming
            languages.All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of
            files that are stored on a computer called a server. This server is
            connected to the internet. You can then load that website through a
            browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on your computer or your
            phone. Your browser is also called the client in this situation.
          </p>

            <b>Stages to follow:</b><br /><br />
            Stage 1 – HTML: <br /><br />HTML, you have heard about it lots of
            times before. If I am not wrong HTML is the language you have
            learned in your school life. Yes, it’s actually the same as what you
            have learned a long time ago but as long as time changes
            technologies are changes. Nowadays as you have grown up, even HTML
            has been grown up too, now there is called HTML5 which comes into
            existence. What? Worried about what is it? Don’t be. I just said
            that as we have grown up HTML has grown up too but the difference
            between us and HTML is, it changed its name to HTML5. In HTML5, you
            can not just prepare the basic structure of the web page but we have
            many more things that we can do. We can store and process values on
            variables on-page itself without any databases as we do in any
            programming languages (Temporary variables), we can develop games on
            it. No need for the flash to play animations on it. Even we can
            develop a fully functional blog with HTML4 itself without any help
            to server-side scripting languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stage 2 – CSS: <br /><br />We live in such a society where everybody
            wants to look pretty, beautiful, to achieve this everyone does
            makeup. Similarly, CSS does for HTML. CSS creates the beauty on HTML
            pages. With the help of CSS, you can make your web page colorful and
            smooth. You can even create animations using CSS. You can add
            transitions, changing the scrolling events of your pages, mouse
            click events and many more. But as HTML changes to HTML5, CSS also
            has been changed to CSS3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stage 3 – JAVASCRIPT: <br /><br />You have learned how your site
            will look like, you have designed the beauty of your page yet. Now,
            it’s turn to create some useful tasks that your web page elements
            will do when some activities performed on your web pages like button
            click events, mouse over any text, playing and pausing some
            animations on page, etc. With the help of JAVASCRIPT, you can do
            that easily. One of the best scripting languages used to make a web
            page more smooth, flexible and platform-independent is javascript.
            It’s not that easy to learn but whatever you learned at an easy
            level, that will be enough to do your all tasks.
